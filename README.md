Start position differs from what most of us expected to see, but this arrangement is actually a **long version** of game so you can play with you a bit longer...

## About the game & History behind developing & Future
This was a project for my CS studies, I should have make it with my team, but I ended up making it alone. I've never played backgammon before and it was interesting to create everything from scratch.

This game has a special feature: it combines an element of chance and strategy. For example, chess is a game that does not contain chance, your victory depends only on how accurate your moves are. If you lose in chess, then you can only blame yourself. If you take blackjack, then this is a game that mostly depends on luck and chance plays a decisive role. Backgammon offers a symbiosis of chance and personal strategy. Backgammon is more like real life: you need to act and plan based on the circumstances that you got on the "dices". Backgammon has a deeper philosophical meaning and can teach life. This is what I realized during the creation. However, I do not like backgammon as a game, I like chess more. Therefore, the game will most likely not be developed further. This is the end ... But you can do it if you want.
